# How to contribute

### ‚ùó **Common mistakes**

- Opening a pull request without a description or a proper name is not fun for the reviewer, so try to explain your change as much as possible either by text or a code snippet.
- Adding new dependencies or modifying the `package.json` will most likely be not accepted or will be accepted in a long time since adding a new dependency to the codebase can be tricky.
- This project uses `npm`, so please try to respect the choice and try to use it.

### üìù Useful scripts

These are the useful scripts that you can use while developing. You can find them in the `package.json` file. You can run them by using `npm run <script_name>`.

| Script                 | Description                                    |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `dev`                  | Start the development environment              |
| `build`                | Test and build the app and the `live-demo`     |
| `build:live-demo`      | Only build the `live-demo`                     |
| `build:lib`            | Only build the `library`                       |
| `coverage:web`         | Serve the test coverage report to localhost    |
| `generate:types`       | Generate all the types for the project         |
| `changeset`            | Adds a changelog to the project after a change |
| `test`                 | Run the tests once                             |
| `test:watch`           | Watch the tests                                |
| `test:coverage`        | Create a coverage report for the tests         |
| `clean`                | Remove ./dist and ./live-demo directories      |

When pushing your changes, always include a **changeset** file. You can do this by running the `changeset` script. It will ask you a few questions and then create a file for you. You can read more about it [here](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md).
