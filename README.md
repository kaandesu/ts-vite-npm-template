<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

> [!NOTE]
> This README.md mainly contains information about how to setup the [project](#project-setup) and the [repository/automation](#repository-and-automation-setup). 
>  However, it is also made for users to use this README as a template as well. 
>  So, it is highly recommended to edit this README.md file to make it your own.
> For feature requests, don't hesitate to open an [issue](https://github.com/kaandesu/ts-vite-npm-template/issues/new)!


## Project Setup
1. **_Package Name Setup:_** Change the package name (every occurrence) in `package.json` and `vite.config.ts` files.

2. **_Write your plugin:_** Start writing your plugin in the `src/myPackagePlugin` folder. As a default, entry will be from its `index.ts` file. 
You may change the folder name and/or the entry file name, but don't forget to update the `vite.config.ts` file accordingly.

3. **_ChangesetBot_**: Add Changeset Bot and configure. (See [Changeset Bot](https://github.com/apps/changeset-bot) for details) 


## Repository and Automation Setup

1. **_Workflow Permissions for Automation_**: Visit `https://github.com/[username]/[REPOSITORY]/settings/actions` and add workflow permissions (read & write)..

2. **_Enable Github Pages:_** If you have a live-demo to showcase your package, create a new branch called 'gh-pages' for github pages deployment. (The index.html will be built and deployed to this branch seperately from your plugin build. See [deploy.yaml](.github/workflows/deploy.yaml) workflow, delete the file if you don't need it.)

3. **_Branch Security Rules:_** Visit `https://github.com/[username]/[REPOSITORY]/settings/branches` and set the branch protection rules for `main` and `gh-pages` branches. (Requiring pull request reviews before merging to main branch is highly recommended.)

4. **_Codeowners_**: Edit the codeowners file to add your team members as codeowners. (See [CODEOWNERS](CODEOWNERS) for details)
